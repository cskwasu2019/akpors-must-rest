So the blind man goes into the water, cools himself down, drinks a load of water, walks out the other side and lo and behold, he can SEE!\n\nNow the guy in the wheelchair is getting really excited, starts pushing with all his might, goes into the water, cools himself down, drinks a load of water, and wheels out the other side. Lo and behold, his wheel chair developed NEW TIRES!!!"

When she finally chanced on the letter, she was so excited to see that her husband had taken the time to write her a letter. She kissed the paper when she saw \"My beautiful wife\" at the top, hugged it when she saw “I love you with all my heart” at the bottom, and sniffed it when she realised it smelled of her husband's perfume. Out of excitement, and without even bothering to read the content of the letter, she made up her mind to cook him his favourite meal for dinner that night. She quickly rushed to the kitchen and got to work.\n\nAfter cooking and setting the table, she went to the washroom and took a shower, put on her most attractive nightgown and dressed the bed. Just as she was about to finish laying the bed, her husband walked into the house. When she heard him come in, she went out to welcome him. To her surprise, her husband was furious when he saw her. She became very confused and asked why he wouldn't even let her welcome him with a hug but instead have that angry look on his face.\n\nThe husband asked, \"Did you read the letter I left you on the table?”\n\nThe woman responded, “Oh yes I saw it.

It read,\n\n\"My beautiful wife,\n\nMy company has asked four colleagues and myself to go on a seven-day trip to Dubai for a training program. They said that we can bring along our wives and I thought this will be the best opportunity for us to have the honeymoon we never did after we got married. I have already packed a suitcase for myself, so kindly do too. Our flight leaves at exactly 7 pm, so I will be home at 6 'o' clock for us to go to the airport. No need to cook dinner since there will be food on the plane. Just be prepared to go as soon as I get back. Please be ready before I get back otherwise I will be forced to leave you behind, seeing that the purpose of this trip is for a training program and me bringing you along is just an added bonus. I Love you with all my heart.\""

I stood up and worked my way through the crowd stepping up to the stage. He asked me what is 15 + 15? I thought for 15 seconds and answered, \"18!\".\n\nThe crowd made up of 40,000 were disappointed. They cheered, \"Give him another chance! Give him another chance!\"\n\nThe leader said, \"Well since we have gone to the trouble of getting 40,000 of you all in one place and we have the world-wide press and global broadcast media here, I guess we can give him another chance.\"\n\nHe asked me, \"What is 5 + 5?\"\n\nAfter thinking for thirty-five seconds, I said, \"90!\"\n\nHe was quite perplexed, he looked down and sighed dejectedly. Everyone was disheartened, I started crying and they started jumping and waving their hands shouting, \"Give him another chance! Give him another chance! Give him another chance!\"\n\nThe leader, unsure whether or not he was doing more harm than damage said, \"Okay! Okay! Just one more chance, what is 2 + 2?\"\n\nI closed my eyes, and after a whole minute, I replied, \"4!\"\n\nThroughout the stadium, pandemonium broke out as the crowd jumped to their feet, waved their hands, stamped their feets on the ground and shouted, \"Give him another chance!

One day, Mr. David decided to invest his money in a small, but growing telecom business. After weeks of negotiations, he bought the company outright. But, after signing on the dotted line, he realized that he knew nothing about running such a business and quickly set out to hire someone who could do that for him.\n\nThe next day, he had set up three interviews. The first guy was great. He knew everything he needed to and was very interesting. At the end of the interview, Mr. David asked him, \"Do you notice anything different about me?\"\n\nAnd the gentleman answered, \"Why yes, I couldn't help, but notice you have no ears.\n\nDave got very angry and threw him out. The second interview was with a woman, and she was even better than the first guy. He asked her the same question, \"Do you notice anything different about me?\"\n\nAnd she replied, \"Well, you have no ears.\"\n\nDavid again was upset and tossed her out. The third and last interview was the best of all three. It was with a very young man, who was fresh out of college. He was smart. He was handsome and he seemed to be a better businessman than the first two put together. David was anxious, but went ahead and asked the young man the same question, \"Do you notice anything different about me?\"\n\nAnd to his surprise, the young man answered, \"Yes. You wear contact lenses.\"\n\nDavid was shocked and said, \"What an incredibly observant young man. How in the world did you know that?\n\n\"The young man fell off his chair laughing hysterically and replied, \"Well, it's pretty damn hard to wear glasses with no ears!\""

When the conversation was concluded, the broker asked him his email.\n\nThe man replied, \"I don't have an email.\"\n\nThe broker answered curiously, \"You don't have an email and yet have succeeded to build an empire. Can you imagine what you could have been if you had an email?!\"\n\nThe man thought for a while and replied, \"Yes, I'd be an office boy at Microsoft!\"\n\nMoral of the story...\n\n1. If you don't have an email and work hard, you can be a millionaire.\n\n2. If you received this message by email, you are probably already an office boy/girl and not any close to being a Billionaire.\n\nP.S: Do not forward this email back to me, I' m closing my email and going to sell tomatoes!"

Boxers should be exchanged with a G-string, Singlets should be exchanged with Bras. If she gives you roll-on, buy her 'Lip gloss'. She gives you cufflinks, give her rubber band to tie her natural hair. If she shows up at your door empty-handed, put NTA, AIT, STV or African Magic for her to watch. Put off your generator. If she asks for an expensive dinner, take her to an expensive vigil, MFM or The LORD'S CHOSEN to be precise. She gives you a flower, give her Ugu (Vegetables), both are natural. If she gives you cake, you give her beancake (akara). If she gives you lacasera, buy her kunu.\n\nWe don't want this Year's Valentine to be one-sided anymore.\n\nSigned  \nNigerian Association of Boyfriends (NAB)"

The old man asked, \"What are the greens fees?\"\n\nSt. Peter replied, \"This is heaven, you play for free.\"\n\nNext, they went to the clubhouse and saw the lavish buffet lunch with the cuisines of the world laid out. \"How much to eat?\" asked the old man.\n\n\"Don't you understand yet? This is Heaven, it is free!\" St. Peter replied, with some exasperation.\n\n\"Well, where are the low fat and low cholesterol tables?\" the old man asked timidly.\n\nSt. Peter lectured, \"That's the best part, you can eat as much as you like of whatever you like and you never get fat and you never get sick either. This is, after all, Heaven.\"\n\nWith that, the old man went into a fit of anger, throwing down his hat and stomping on it, and screaming wildly.

It's that the money she want me to leave?\n\nSardine = N150, indomie (hungry man size) = N100, 2 eggs = N60, plastic Coke = 100. Total N410, and you say 500 naira is small money?\n\nI'll use 500 naira to buy 3 albums and good earpiece?\n\nRice N100, beans N50, meat N100, plastic malt N100 and remaining 150 to play Nairabet... and she says 500 naira is chicken change? I swear she's not well.\n\nI hope she knows that half carton of Indomie noodles is N500 naira.\n\nDo you know how many players Arsene Wenger of Arsenal will buy with 500 Naira?\n\nThe most annoying thing is that it's possible this girl has never given 500 naira offering for church\n\nOn a serious note, you won't know the value of 500 naira, until you borrow 500 naira credit from MTN and you have to pay back."

Akpos sent his Christmas Day gift with the following note:\n\n\"This special Christmas Day gift was chosen because I noticed you are in the habit of not wearing any when we go out in the evenings. If it had not been for my sister Cynthia, I would have chosen the ones with buttons, but she prefers short ones that are much easier to remove.\n\n\"These are lovely ones, the lady I bought them from showed me the pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and they were hardly soiled. I had her try yours on for me and they looked quite lovely. I wish I was there to put them on you for the first time; no doubt, other hands will come into contact with them before I have a chance to see you again. When you take them off, remember to blow on them lightly before putting them away as they will naturally be a little damp from wearing. Just think how many times I'll be kissing them in the future. I hope you will wear them on Sunday night for me.\"\n\nFrom Akpos, your darling."

So all the English grammar and idiomatic expressions are completely useless now.  \n  \nTo my CHEMISTRY TEACHER, you tried so hard, but I couldn't understand your subject. Anyway, all the chemical compounds and Sodium Nitrogen you mentioned, I haven't come across any of them in life yet.  \n  \nTo my BIOLOGY TEACHER, your class was the most interesting, especially the topic 'REPRODUCTION' but now I am shocked to see 'same-sex marriage'. You didn't make mention of it at all.  \n  \nTo my CRK TEACHER, at least I remember you telling us how God created Heaven and this planet Earth, But what you forgot to tell us is who created Mars, Pluto and other planets.  \n  \nTo my ECONOMICS TEACHER, inflation, production, distribution, consumption. Well... My economisation hasn't been poor because I paid so much attention.  \n  \nTo my GEOGRAPHY TEACHER, you were sometimes funny, I still can't understand how the Earth Rotates around the Sun (yet my house is not moving). The Raining and Dry season you talked about, I don't seem to understand the season anymore.  \n  \nTo my HISTORY TEACHER, thanks for keeping records of the past, the future really matter now.  \n  \nI will send my next letter to the Principal, Staffs and other teachers I didn't mention."

In fact, last month...  \n  \nshe complained and complained and complained for hours. God had to call an Angel to take notes of her complaints.

Eventually, a 3rd Angel came with a voice recorder as a back-up.  \n  \nAfter 3 days, she finally finished. Adam went next...  \n  \nADAM: LORD, it's just a little misunderstanding. We just want YOU to tell us if we should...  \n  \nHe was done in 3 mins. God said, \"I will get back to you in 5 days.  \n  \nThe Angels worked for 4 days to summarize all Eve said into a thick cover notebook. God went through it and also through what Adam said.

I see that the Coke is getting warm and decide I should put it in the refrigerator to keep it cold.  \n  \nAs I head toward the kitchen with the Coke, a vase of flowers on the counter catches my eye - they need to be watered. I set the Coke down on the counter, and I discover my reading glasses that I've been searching for all morning,  \n  \nI decide I better put them back on my desk, but first I'm going to water the flowers.  \n  \nI set the glasses back down on the counter, fill a container with water and suddenly I spot the TV remote.

I realize that tonight when we go to watch TV, I will be looking for the remote, but won't remember it's on the kitchen table, so I decide to put it back in the den where it belongs, but first I'll water the flowers.  \n  \nI pour some water in the flowers, but quite a bit of it spills on the floor.

I see that the Coke is getting warm and decide I should put it in the refrigerator to keep it cold.  \n  \nAs I head toward the kitchen with the Coke, a vase of flowers on the counter catches my eye - they need to be watered. I set the Coke down on the counter, and I discover my reading glasses that I've been searching for all morning,  \n  \nI decide I better put them back on my desk, but first I'm going to water the flowers.  \n  \nI set the glasses back down on the counter, fill a container with water and suddenly I spot the TV remote. Someone left it on the kitchen table. I realize that tonight when we go to watch TV, I will be looking for the remote, but won't remember it's on the kitchen table, so I decide to put it back in the den where it belongs, but first I'll water the flowers.  \n  \nI pour some water in the flowers, but quite a bit of it spills on the floor. So, I set the remote back down on the table, get some mop to wipe up the spill.  \n  \nThen, I head down the hall trying to remember what I was planning to do.  \n  \nAt the end of the day:  \n  \n* The car isn't washed,  \n  \n* The bills aren't paid,  \n  \n* There is a warm can of Coke sitting on the counter,  \n  \n* The flowers don't have enough water,  \n  \n* There is still only 1 cheque in my checkbook,  \n  \n* I can't find the remote,  \n  \n* I can't find my glasses,  \n  \n* And I don't remember what I did with the car keys.  \n  \nThen, when I try to figure out why nothing got done today, I'm really baffled because I know I was busy all day long, and I'm really tired  \n  \nI realize this is a serious problem, and I'll try to get some help for it, but first I'll check my e-mail.  \n  \nDo me a favour, will you?

I see that the Coke is getting warm and decide I should put it in the refrigerator to keep it cold.  \n  \nAs I head toward the kitchen with the Coke, a vase of flowers on the counter catches my eye - they need to be watered. I set the Coke down on the counter, and I discover my reading glasses that I've been searching for all morning,  \n  \nI decide I better put them back on my desk, but first I'm going to water the flowers.  \n  \nI set the glasses back down on the counter, fill a container with water and suddenly I spot the TV remote. Someone left it on the kitchen table. I realize that tonight when we go to watch TV, I will be looking for the remote, but won't remember it's on the kitchen table, so I decide to put it back in the den where it belongs, but first I'll water the flowers.  \n  \nI pour some water in the flowers, but quite a bit of it spills on the floor. So, I set the remote back down on the table, get some mop to wipe up the spill.  \n  \nThen, I head down the hall trying to remember what I was planning to do.  \n  \nAt the end of the day:  \n  \n* The car isn't washed,  \n  \n* The bills aren't paid,  \n  \n* There is a warm can of Coke sitting on the counter,  \n  \n* The flowers don't have enough water,  \n  \n* There is still only 1 cheque in my checkbook,  \n  \n* I can't find the remote,  \n  \n* I can't find my glasses,  \n  \n* And I don't remember what I did with the car keys.  \n  \nThen, when I try to figure out why nothing got done today, I'm really baffled because I know I was busy all day long, and I'm really tired  \n  \nI realize this is a serious problem, and I'll try to get some help for it, but first I'll check my e-mail.  \n  \nDo me a favour, will you? Forward this message to everyone you know, because I don't remember to whom it has been sent.  \n  \nDon't laugh -- if this isn't you yet, your day is coming!"

The girls in front of me were having a conversation about their first time experience in a plane...  \n  \nThe first girl said, \"Kate, you won't believe were me and my boyfriend spent our holidays last month.\"  \n  \nKate answered, \"Please tell me about it.\"  \n  \nMARY: We boarded a plane to France. We were in the first class cabin, I was sitting close to the pilot, they were serving us many delicacies like cake, meat pie, red wine, palm wine, suya, roasted yam, etc. Later the plane became stuffy, I had to roll down the window. I saw everybody on the ground, I saw my house, I even saw that your fine brother.  \n  \nKATE: That means you enjoyed a lot on the plane.  \n  \nMARY: Very much!  \n  \nKATE: My boyfriend and I travelled to Canada too. The journey was so enjoyable except when the plane had a flat tyre. We had to park and call a roadside mechanic to replace the flat tyre. Later, we were caught up in traffic. The pilot had to come out to control the traffic so we could have a free passage. Few hours later, the plane's fuel finished. One of the stewardesses had to take a Jerrycan to the petrol station to get some fuel...  \n  \nAnd they went on and on. I just told the driver to drop me by the roadside before I suffocate from lies."

We went behind the village tavern where you leaned against the back fence and I made love to you.''  \n  \n\"Yes,\" she says, ''I remember it well.''  \n  \n\"OK,'' he says, ''How about taking a stroll around there again and we can do it for old time's sake?''  \n  \n\"Oh Jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!''  \n  \nA police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, I've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.  \n  \nThe elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence. The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in...  \n  \nThen suddenly, they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground. The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know...  \n  \nAfter about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is. So, as the couple passes, he says to them, ''Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?''  \n  \nShaking, the old man is barely able to reply, ''Fifty years ago that wasn't an electric fence.\""

As a last wish, she informed the undertaker that she wanted the following inscription engraved on her tombstone:  \n  \n\"BORN A VIRGIN, LIVED AS A VIRGIN, DIED A VIRGIN\"  \n  \nNot long after, the old woman died peacefully.  \n  \nA few days after the funeral, as the undertaker/postal clerk went to prepare the gravestone that the lady had requested, it became quite apparent that the tombstone that she had selected was much too small for the wording that she had chosen.  \n  \nHe thought long and hard about how he could fulfill the old woman's final request, considering the very limited space available on the small piece of stone. For days, he agonized over the dilemma. But finally his experience as a postal worker allowed him to come up with what he thought was the appropriate solution to the problem.  \n  \nThe virgin's tombstone was finally completed and duly engraved, and it read as follows:  \n  \n\"RETURNED UNOPENED\""

He, however, was sent to hell.  \n  \nNeedless to say, the pastor was pretty surprised by this turn of events and asked God why he, who had constantly talked to people about God, had been sent to hell and a bus driver was going to heaven. God replied, We judge whether one goes to heaven not by the words he has said but the deeds he has done on the earth. While you talked about God, people slept, but they all remembered me when the bus driver drove.\""

Instead of explaining things to Johnny, she told him to hide behind the curtains one night and watch his older sister and her boyfriend. This he did, and the following morning, Johnny described everything to his mother.  \n  \n\"Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked for awhile, then he turned off most of the lights. Then he started to kiss and hug her, I figured sis must be getting sick because her face started looking funny. He must have thought so too because he put his hand inside her blouse to feel her heart, just like the doctor would. Except he's not as good as the doctor, because he seemed to have trouble finding her heart.  \n  \nHe was getting sick too, because pretty soon both of them started panting and getting all out of breath. His other hand must have been getting cold because he put it under her skirt. About this time, sis got toward the end of the couch. This was when the fever started. I know it was a fever because sis told him she was really hot.  \n  \nFinally, I found out what was making them so sick... a big snake had gotten inside his pants somehow. It just jumped out of his pants and stood there about 9 inches long. Honest! Anyway, he grabbed it in one hand to keep it from getting away. When sis saw it she got really scared. Her eyes big and her mouth fell open, and she started calling out to God and stuff like that. I should tell her about the ones I saw at the river!  \n  \nAnyway, sis got brave and tried to kill the snake by biting its head off. All of a sudden, she made a noise and let the snake go. I guess it bit her back. Then she grabbed it with both hands and held it tight while he took a nylon cover out of his pocket and slipped it over the snake's head to keep it from biting again. Sis lay back and spread her legs so she could get a scissor lock on it, and he helped by laying on the top of the snake. The snake put up a hell of a fight. Sis started groaning and squealing and her boyfriend almost upset the couch. I guess they wanted to kill the snake by squishing it between them.  \n  \nAfter a while, they both quit moving and gave a great sigh. Her boyfriend sat up and sure enough they had killed the snake. I knew it was dead because it just hung there limp and some of its insides were hanging out. Sis and her boyfriend were a little tired from the battle, but they went on toasting anyway. He started hugging and kissing her again, and lo and behold, the snake wasn't dead after all. It jumped straight up and started to fight again. I guess snakes are like cats... they have nine lives or something.  \n  \nThis time sis jumped up and tried to kill the snake by sitting on it. After about 35 minutes of struggle, they finally killed the snake. I know it was dead this time because I saw sis' boyfriend peel off the skin and flush it down the toilet.\"  \n  \nMother fainted!!!"

Instead of explaining things to Johnny, she told him to hide behind the curtains one night and watch his older sister and her boyfriend. This he did, and the following morning, Johnny described everything to his mother.  \n  \n\"Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked for awhile, then he turned off most of the lights. Then he started to kiss and hug her, I figured sis must be getting sick because her face started looking funny. He must have thought so too because he put his hand inside her blouse to feel her heart, just like the doctor would. Except he's not as good as the doctor, because he seemed to have trouble finding her heart.  \n  \nHe was getting sick too, because pretty soon both of them started panting and getting all out of breath. His other hand must have been getting cold because he put it under her skirt. About this time, sis got toward the end of the couch. This was when the fever started. I know it was a fever because sis told him she was really hot.  \n  \nFinally, I found out what was making them so sick... a big snake had gotten inside his pants somehow. It just jumped out of his pants and stood there about 9 inches long. Honest! Anyway, he grabbed it in one hand to keep it from getting away. When sis saw it she got really scared. Her eyes big and her mouth fell open, and she started calling out to God and stuff like that. I should tell her about the ones I saw at the river!  \n  \nAnyway, sis got brave and tried to kill the snake by biting its head off. All of a sudden, she made a noise and let the snake go. I guess it bit her back. Then she grabbed it with both hands and held it tight while he took a nylon cover out of his pocket and slipped it over the snake's head to keep it from biting again. Sis lay back and spread her legs so she could get a scissor lock on it, and he helped by laying on the top of the snake. The snake put up a hell of a fight. Sis started groaning and squealing and her boyfriend almost upset the couch. I guess they wanted to kill the snake by squishing it between them.  \n  \nAfter a while, they both quit moving and gave a great sigh. Her boyfriend sat up and sure enough they had killed the snake. I knew it was dead because it just hung there limp and some of its insides were hanging out. Sis and her boyfriend were a little tired from the battle, but they went on toasting anyway. He started hugging and kissing her again, and lo and behold, the snake wasn't dead after all. It jumped straight up and started to fight again. I guess snakes are like cats... they have nine lives or something.  \n  \nThis time sis jumped up and tried to kill the snake by sitting on it. After about 35 minutes of struggle, they finally killed the snake. I know it was dead this time because I saw sis' boyfriend peel off the skin and flush it down the toilet.\"  \n  \nMother fainted!!!"

This coincided with the period that Isaiah and Jeremiah were engaged in Lamentation for Ezekiel and Daniel their friend. By that time, Amos and Obadiah were not around.  \n  \nThree days later, Hosea, Joel and Jonah travelled in the same ship with Micah and Nahum to Jerusalem. Habakkuk then visited Zephaniah who introduced him to Haggai a friend of Zechariah whose cousin is Malachi.  \n  \nImmediately after the old tradition, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John got involved in Acts with the Romans who were behaving like the Corinthians, who were also always at loggerhead with the Galatians. At that time too, the Ephesians realizing that the Philippians were close to the Colossians, suggested to the Thessalonians that they should first of all see Timothy who had gone to the house of Titus to teach Philemon his younger brother how to read and write in Hebrew.  \n  \nOn hearing this, James asked Peter to explain to him how the three Johns have disclosed to Jude, the Revelation of my journey."

However, he was late, so the Priest decided to say his own few words while they waited.  \n  \nHe commenced with: Thank Goodness we Catholics have a wonderful sense of humour! I got my first impression of this parish from the very first confession I ever heard here. I thought I had been assigned to a terrible place. The very first person who entered my confessional told me he had stolen a television set and, when questioned by the police, was able to lie his way out of it. He had stolen money from his parents, embezzled from his employer, had an affair with his bosss wife, had sex with his bosss 17 year old daughter on numerous occasions, taken illegal drugs, had several homosexual affairs, was arrested several times for public nudity. I was appalled that one person could do so many awful things. But as the days went on, I learned that my people were not all like that and I had, indeed, come to a fine parish full of good and loving people.  \n  \nJust as the Priest finished his talk, the politician arrived full of apologies at being late. He immediately began to make the presentation and gave his talk:  \n  \nIll never forget the first day our parish Priest arrived, said the politician. In fact, I had the honour of being the first person to go to him for confession.  \n  \nMoral: Never, Never, Never Be Late!"

You are the hypotenuse of my right angled triangle and on using either sine or cosine, we can obtain a real solution. I tried to deal with you on a calculator version but the probability of success is very low.  \n  \nMy letter consists of only one section to be answered without a calculator and the answer is to be given \"Yes\" in three significant figures.

In addition, Wife 1.0 installed itself into all other programs and now monitors all other system activity. Applications such as Poker Night 10.3, Football 5.0, Hunting and Fishing 7.5, and Racing 3.6 no longer run, crashing the system whenever selected.  \n  \nI can't seem to keep Wife 1.0 in the background while attempting to run my favourite applications. I'm thinking about going back to Girlfriend 7.0, but the uninstall doesn't work on Wife 1.0. Please help!  \n  \nThanks,  \nA Troubled User (KEEP READING)  \n______________________________________  \nREPLY:  \nDear Troubled User:  \n  \nThis is a very common problem that men complain about. Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0, thinking that it is just a Utilities and Entertainment program. Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM and is designed by its Creator to run EVERYTHING!!! It is also impossible to delete Wife 1.0 and to return to Girlfriend 7.0. It is impossible to uninstall, or purge the program files from the system once installed.  \n  \nYou cannot go back to Girlfriend 7.0 because Wife 1.0 is designed to not allow this. Look in your Wife 1.0 manual under Warnings-Alimony-Child Support. I recommend that you keep Wife 1.0 and work on improving the situation. I suggest installing the background application \"Yes Dear\" to alleviate software augmentation.  \n  \nThe best course of action is to enter the command C:APOLOGIZE because ultimately you will have to give the APOLOGIZE command before the system will return to normal anyway.  \n  \nWife 1.0 is a great program, but it tends to be very high maintenance. Wife 1.0 comes with several support programs, such as Clean and Sweep 3.0, Cook It 1.5 and Do Bills 4.2.  \n  \nHowever, be very careful how you use these programs. Improper use will cause the system to launch the program Nag Nag 9.5. Once this happens, the only way to improve the performance of Wife 1.0 is to purchase additional software. I recommend Flowers 2.1 and Diamonds 5.0!  \n  \nWARNING!!! DO NOT, under any circumstances, install Secretary With Short Skirt 3.3. This application is not supported by Wife 1.0 and will cause irreversible damage to the operating system!  \n  \nBest of luck,  \nTech Support"

In addition, Wife 1.0 installed itself into all other programs and now monitors all other system activity. Applications such as Poker Night 10.3, Football 5.0, Hunting and Fishing 7.5, and Racing 3.6 no longer run, crashing the system whenever selected.  \n  \nI can't seem to keep Wife 1.0 in the background while attempting to run my favourite applications. I'm thinking about going back to Girlfriend 7.0, but the uninstall doesn't work on Wife 1.0. Please help!  \n  \nThanks,  \nA Troubled User (KEEP READING)  \n______________________________________  \nREPLY:  \nDear Troubled User:  \n  \nThis is a very common problem that men complain about. Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0, thinking that it is just a Utilities and Entertainment program. Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM and is designed by its Creator to run EVERYTHING!!! It is also impossible to delete Wife 1.0 and to return to Girlfriend 7.0. It is impossible to uninstall, or purge the program files from the system once installed.  \n  \nYou cannot go back to Girlfriend 7.0 because Wife 1.0 is designed to not allow this. Look in your Wife 1.0 manual under Warnings-Alimony-Child Support. I recommend that you keep Wife 1.0 and work on improving the situation. I suggest installing the background application \"Yes Dear\" to alleviate software augmentation.  \n  \nThe best course of action is to enter the command C:APOLOGIZE because ultimately you will have to give the APOLOGIZE command before the system will return to normal anyway.  \n  \nWife 1.0 is a great program, but it tends to be very high maintenance. Wife 1.0 comes with several support programs, such as Clean and Sweep 3.0, Cook It 1.5 and Do Bills 4.2.  \n  \nHowever, be very careful how you use these programs. Improper use will cause the system to launch the program Nag Nag 9.5. Once this happens, the only way to improve the performance of Wife 1.0 is to purchase additional software. I recommend Flowers 2.1 and Diamonds 5.0!  \n  \nWARNING!!! DO NOT, under any circumstances, install Secretary With Short Skirt 3.3. This application is not supported by Wife 1.0 and will cause irreversible damage to the operating system!  \n  \nBest of luck,  \nTech Support"

Unfortunately, there wasn't enough to feed the three men, so they came to an agreement that they should sleep on it and whoever has the best dream will win the food.  \n  \nThe next morning when they awoke, Akpos and Thambo looked at Gyan and asked, \"What did you dream of?\"  \n  \nGyan said, \"I dreamt I visited the queen in her royal palace.\"  \n  \nThey both were amused by his dream. Next, Gyan and Akpos looked at Thambo and asked, \"What did you dream of?\"  \n  \nHe told them, \"I dreamt that I was part of the Real Madrid team that won the Champions League last season.\"  \n  \nThey were amused by his dream.

An Ugly girl will tag 100 people in a picture and still get two likes on Facebook (probably from her family members).  \n  \n2. Guys will feel free when talking to an ugly girl because they see you as another guy. Some will even seek your advice on how to woo (toast) another girl.  \n  \n3. Whenever a group of girls want to take a group picture, they will hand over the camera to the ugliest amongst them. If you're that girl, then your friends are subtly telling you that you're ugly.  \n  \n4. Whenever there are drama rehearsals in a church, they always pick the ugly girl to play the role of a witch, a vampire or a demon.  \n  \n5. Most girls with sweet names on Facebook and twitter like 'mo cute', 'pink berry', 'sexydiva', 'prettydamsel', 'finest chick', etc... are usually very ugly.  \n  \n6. Ugly girls wont like this post and would comment harshly because they are angry with me right now for exposing them.  \n  \nYou can add other signs to identify ugly girls in the comment box below..."

Then he asked me to do him a favour.  \n  \nI said, \"Sure, if I can.\"  \n  \nHe said he was a bit sad that his son never said goodbye to him before passing on.

But for our movie buffs, we will be flying right next to Arik Air, where their movie will be visible from the right side of the cabin window.  \n  \nThere is no smoking allowed in this plane. Any smoke you see in the cabin is only the early warning system on the engines telling us to slow down! In order to catch important landmarks, we try to fly as close as possible for the best view. If, however, we go a little too close, do let us know. Our enthusiastic co-pilot sometimes flies right through the landmark!  \n  \nKindly be seated, keep your seat in an upright position for take-off and fasten your seatbelt. For those of you who cant find a seatbelt, kindly fasten your own belt to the arm of your seat and for those of you who cant find a seat, do not hesitate to get in touch with a stewardess who will explain how to fasten yourself to your suitcase.\"  \n  \nEnjoy flying with Dana Airlines"

Incredibly drunk and walking home, they suddenly realized they both needed to pee. They were very near a graveyard and one of them suggested they do their business behind a headstone or something. The first woman had nothing to wipe with so she took off her panties, used them and threw them away. Her friend however was wearing an expensive underwear set and didn't want to ruin hers, but was lucky enough to salvage a large ribbon from a wreath that was on a grave and proceeded to wipe herself with it. After finishing, they made their way home.  \n  \nThe next day, the first woman's husband phones the other husband and said, \"These damn girls nights out have got to stop. My wife came home last night without her panties.\"  \n  \n\"That's nothing,\" said the other. \"Mine came back with a sympathy card stuck between the cheeks of her butt that said, 'From all of us at the Fire Station, Well never forget you!'"

After finishing, they made their way home.  \n  \nThe next day, the first woman's husband phones the other husband and said, \"These damn girls nights out have got to stop. My wife came home last night without her panties.\"  \n  \n\"That's nothing,\" said the other. \"Mine came back with a sympathy card stuck between the cheeks of her butt that said, 'From all of us at the Fire Station, Well never forget you!'"

When it got in between the two circles, it turned and started crawling towards the black circle.  \n  \nAkpos watched and immediately it was about entering the black circle, Akpos picked it and gently dropped it inside the white circle.  \n  \nThe native doctor who got furious asked Akpos why he did that.

Since I lived in the countryside I called my wife and told her that I would be late because I had to walk home.  \n  \nOn my way, I passed by a small diner and the odour of baked beans was more than I could stand. With miles to walk, I figured that I would walk off any ill effects by the time I reached home, so I stopped at the diner and before I knew it, I had consumed three large orders of baked beans.  \n  \nAll the way home, I made sure that I released all the gas. Upon my arrival, my wife seemed excited to see! me and exclaimed delightedly \"Darling I have a surprise for dinner tonight.\" She then blindfolded me and led me to my chair at the dinner table. I took a seat and just as she was about to remove my blindfold, the telephone rang. She made me promise not to touch the blindfold until she returned and went to answer the call.  \n  \nThe baked beans I had consumed were still affecting me and the pressure was becoming most unbearable, so while my wife was out of the room I seized the opportunity, shifted my weight to one leg and let one go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of a pulpwood mill. I took my napkin from my lap and fanned the air around mevigorously. Then, shifting to the other cheek, I ripped off three more. The stink was worse than cooked cabbage. Keeping my ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the other room, I went on like this for another few minutes. The pleasure was indescribable.  \n  \nWhen eventually the telephone farewells signalled the end of my freedom, I quickly fanned the air a few more times with my napkin, placed it on my lap and folded my hands back on it feeling very relieved and pleased with myself. My face must have been the picture of innocence when my wife returned, apologizing for taking so long. She asked me if I had peeked through the blindfold, and I assured her I had not.  \n  \nAt this point, she removed the blindfold, and twelve dinner guests seated around the table chorused: \"Happy Birthday!!!\" I fainted!"

Upon my arrival, my wife seemed excited to see! me and exclaimed delightedly \"Darling I have a surprise for dinner tonight.\" She then blindfolded me and led me to my chair at the dinner table. I took a seat and just as she was about to remove my blindfold, the telephone rang. She made me promise not to touch the blindfold until she returned and went to answer the call.  \n  \nThe baked beans I had consumed were still affecting me and the pressure was becoming most unbearable, so while my wife was out of the room I seized the opportunity, shifted my weight to one leg and let one go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of a pulpwood mill. I took my napkin from my lap and fanned the air around mevigorously. Then, shifting to the other cheek, I ripped off three more. The stink was worse than cooked cabbage. Keeping my ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the other room, I went on like this for another few minutes. The pleasure was indescribable.  \n  \nWhen eventually the telephone farewells signalled the end of my freedom, I quickly fanned the air a few more times with my napkin, placed it on my lap and folded my hands back on it feeling very relieved and pleased with myself. My face must have been the picture of innocence when my wife returned, apologizing for taking so long. She asked me if I had peeked through the blindfold, and I assured her I had not.  \n  \nAt this point, she removed the blindfold, and twelve dinner guests seated around the table chorused: \"Happy Birthday!!!\" I fainted!"

Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme.  \n  \nThe next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.  \n  \nThe King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.  \n  \nUpon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1,000 gold coins.

This time the manager came and had to calm down the West Indian, because he did not want anything to upset the other customers. He let him go.  \n  \nTen minutes later, the Nigerian walked in. He sat down. Lit up a cigarette, and ordered the most expensive meal on the menu, plus two bottles of Wine.
